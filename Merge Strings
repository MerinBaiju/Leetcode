You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        out=[]
        i=0
        l=len(word1)
        l1=len(word2)
        while(i<l)or(i<l1):
            if(i<l):
                out.append(word1[i])
            if(i<l1):
                out.append(word2[i])
            i+=1
        return ''.join(out)
